# Python Project

Let's learn Python together!

This repo contains the basic bare bones for a python web app.

It uses [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/), which is a framework that allows us to easily build and launch web applications written in python.

It uses the [Cats As A Service](https://cataas.com/) API to demonstrate a basic API call to a url endpoint.

We can use this repo to practice making changes to a github project and ultimately build a good portfolio project. 

## How to use this repo:
- FORK the repo
- CLONE the repo from your fork
- On your computer, cd into the folder "python-project"
- Run the app from your terminal using the command `FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`
